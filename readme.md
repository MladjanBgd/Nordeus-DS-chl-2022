This repository is implementation of MLP for forecasting of Retention Day 1 as part of Nordeus Challange 2022. Solution is implemented in python using standard keras library.
Originally it was used HistGradientBoostingRegressor whick didn't get good result so I switched to NN witch gave some improvementâ€™s regrading MSE.

Task:
